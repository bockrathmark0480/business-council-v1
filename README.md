# MAB AI Business Council

A single-page web experience for orchestrating multi-agent business councils. It supports building custom councils, combining template councils, and revisiting previous decisions through the library.

## Features

- **Custom Council Builder** – Choose any combination of roles while always anchoring the Core Brain/EA orchestration. Generate weighted reasoning flows for your decision brief.
- **Interactive Council Simulation** – Watch the Core Brain and selected roles progress through a live timeline, with influence-weighted insights, progress tracking, and an automatically generated action plan.
- **Template Councils** – Start from curated role groupings (e.g., Council of Engineers, Council of C-Suite) and merge multiple templates into a custom deliberation.
- **Library & Role Encyclopedia** – Review and resume prior decisions (stored in local storage) and browse detailed role definitions and reasoning weights.
- **Future Iterations Preview** – Highlights planned submissions and analytics integrations to keep the system extensible.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Explore the landing page and choose between the Custom Council, Template Councils, or Library options.
3. Submit a decision brief to generate a synthesized council response. Decisions persist in your browser for quick recall.

The app is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it easy to host on any static site provider.
